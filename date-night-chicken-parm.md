## Instructions

### Chicken, Part 1
1. Combine garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil in a large baking dish. Season chicken cutlets all over with salt (about 1/2 tsp. salt per cutlet). Add to marinade and turn to coat. Let sit at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour.
2. Prepare your dreding station. In one bowl, whisk eggs, garlic powder, onion powder, ½ tsp. salt, black pepper, and 2 tbsp. water. In another bowl, combine the panko, oregano, basil, and thyme. In a third bowl, combine the flour with 1/2 tsp. salt..
3. Working with 1 cutlet at a time and letting any excess marinade drip back into baking dish, dredge cutlets in flour, knocking off excess, then dip into egg wash, letting excess drip back into bowl. Dredge in panko, pressing firmly to adhere, ensuring no bare spots remain. Gently shake off excess and place cutlets on a rimmed baking sheet. Chill at least 20 minutes and up to 8 hours. (This is important! The fridge time makes your chicken much easier to fry later.)

### Sauce
1. Sauté the pancetta on medium heat until the fat is rendered. Scoop out the pancetta with a slotted spoon and set aside.
2. Add the olive oil, garlic, shallots, and red pepper flakes. Sauté on medium heat for 10 minutes, turning the heat down and adding a few tbsp water if the garlic and shallot start to brown.
3. Add the tomato paste, sugar, and vodka. Cook until the paste is incorporated and the vodka is mostly evaporated.
4. Add the peeled tomatoes plus 1/2 cup of water. After 10 minutes, use a fork or potato masher to break up the tomatoes until thoroughly incorporated. Simmer until the water is evaporated and the tomatoes are tender.
5. Turn the heat to medium-low and add the heavy cream. Cook for another few minutes to reduce, and add salt to taste. Set aside.

### Chicken, Part 2
1. Remove your cutlets from the fridge at least 30 minutes before frying. Set a wire rack inside a second large rimmed baking sheet. Turn your broiler to medium/450.
2. Pour vegetable oil, ghee or a combination into a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat until it is 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep. Let it get up to frying temperature.
3. Working one at a time, place the breaded cutlets in the hot pan and fry until they're at an internal temperature of 160, flipping at least once. Transfer to wire rack; season with salt.
4. Cover cutlets with a layer of sauce (using about half of the reserved sauce) torn basil leaves, and a layer of cheese. Allow some crispy corners and edges to remain bare. Broil until cheese is melted and browned in spots. This should take about 5 minutes, but keep a close eye on it.

### Pasta
1. Heat water over high heat with 1 tsp. salt. Add the pasta and cook according to the directions.
2. Return the remaining sauce to a sauté pan on medium-low heat. Add the reserved pancetta. Thin out using pasta water if it reduces too much.
3. Once pasta is fully cooked, drain and add to sauce. Cook a few minutes on medium-low and toss to incorporate. Salt to taste.

### El Finale!
1. Plate some pasta along with one cutlet. Enjoy.
