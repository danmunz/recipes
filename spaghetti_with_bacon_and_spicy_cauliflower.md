# Spaghetti with Bacon and Spicy Cauliflower

## Notes
- The key to this whole thing is the sauce.
- I did this as a one-pan meal, but if you feel like cooking the pasta and the sauce separately, you can do things a little faster.

## Ingredients

- 1 head cauliflower, [florets sliced into 1/4"-thick slices](https://madeinaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/How-to-Slice-Cauliflower-Steaks.jpg)

- 1 tsp garlic powder

- 4 oz. spaghetti
