# Spaghetti with Bacon and Spicy Cauliflower

## Notes
- The key to this whole thing is the sauce. It's perfect for when you don't want red sauce but feel like olive oil alone wouldn't carry the acidic tang you're looking for.
- I did this as a one-pan meal, but if you feel like cooking the pasta and the sauce separately, you can do things a little faster.

## Ingredients

- 1 head cauliflower, [florets sliced into 1/4"-thick slices](https://madeinaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/How-to-Slice-Cauliflower-Steaks.jpg)
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1 tsp garlic powder

- 4 oz. spaghetti
- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1.5 tbsp double-concentrated tomato paste
- 1 tsp dried Italian herbs (could be individual ones like oregano, basil, etc. or a premade mixture)
- 2 slices thick-cut bacon
- 2 tbsp Pecorino Romano or similar cheese, grated

## Instructions
1. Heat your oven to 400 degrees, ideally on convection. Toss the cauliflower with extra-virgin olive oil, the garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and a healthy pinch of salt and pepper. Lay out on a foil-lined baking sheet. Roast for 15-20 minutes, turning halfway. The cauliflower should be completely soft and the edges a little black/singed. Remove to cool.
2. While the cauliflower cooks, fill a large saucepan about 1" deep with water. Add salt and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the pasta, and cook for about 10 minutes, until al dente. Preserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water. Drain and set aside.
3. Leave the pan on the stove and turn it to medium heat. Fry two slices of bacon in the pan until crisp. Set aside on a paper towel to cool. Discard about half the bacon grease.
4. Add a splash of extra-virgin olive oil to the pan. Fry the garlic slices in the pan for 30 seconds to 1 minute or until beginning to brown.
5. Add the tomato paste and Italian herbs. Let them fry for 30 seconds to 1 minute, stirring quickly. Add the Italian herbs and a splash of pasta water. Stir to combine.
6. Add the drained spaghetti. Stir to combine.
7. Add the sliced bacon, roasted cauliflower, and remainder of the pasta water. Turn off the heat and stir to combine. Salt to taste.
8. Transfer to a bowl. Top generously with Pecorino Romano and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.
