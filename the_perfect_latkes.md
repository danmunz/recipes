## Notes

This recipe is built on a per-potato basis; just multiply the quantities as you add more potatoes. One potato makes about four latkes.

Note: This recipe takes sides in a key latke debate: Wet batter vs. dry batter. The answer is dry batter. We drain our onions and potatoes thoroughly. We use just enough egg to get things moistened but not liquidy. Here's why: The goal of a latke is crisp-but-not-burnt on the outside, soft-but-not-mushy on the inside. If your batter is too wet, when you drop it into the oil, the oil is going to spend a lot of time just trying to boil the moisture out. In that time, the potatoes in the moisture-filled middle will basically boil into mush, while the ones on the moisture-less outside edges just burn. So the texture we want for our latke batter is basically that of stirring a fairly tight stovetop mac & cheese, with the only real wetness coming from the egg.

These keep great in the fridge or freezer. To reheat, just spread them on a baking sheet (ideally on a wire rack) in a 350° oven (convection, if you have it) for about 10 minutes or until they're warmed to your liking.

## Ingredients

- 1 large baking potato (appx. 1 pound), peeled

_For each potato:_

- 1 small yellow onion or 1/2 a large onion, peeled and quartered
- 1/4 cup matzoh meal
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 4-5 grinds black pepper
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten OR 2 egg whites, lightly beaten OR 1/4 cup egg substitute or liquid egg whites

_And:_

- Non-EV olive oil, or a good neutral oil, for frying

## Equipment

- Nonstick frying pan, ideally 12" or 14"
- Good nonstick spatula
- Wire rack on a baking sheet, with a paper towel between them – placed in a 200° oven if you plan on serving the latkes right away
- Tall glass filled halfway with water
- Medium cream scoop (not strictly necessary but better than just a big spoon)

## Instructions

1. In a food processor or on the large holes of a box grater, shred the potato. Working in batches, spoon a batch of potato onto a kitchen towel, wrap it up, and **wring the absolute heck out of it** over the sink. Seriously, this is your workout for the day. Transfer the potato to a large mixing bowl and repeat until all the potato is processed.

2. Repeat the identical process with the onion.

3. To the bowl with your shredded and _very dry_ potato and onion, add the matzoh meal, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and baking powder. Mix to combine, ensuring clumps of potato and onion are broken up and all the ingredients are distributed equally.

4. Stir in the egg mixture. At this point the batter can sit for a while to let the ingredients come together, but ideally not for longer than 30 minutes as the salt will start drawing excess moisture out of the potato and onion.

5. On the stove, heat a pan with oil about 1/3" deep on medium-high heat. Let the pan get good and hot, because once latke batter hits it the oil will cool instantly.

6. When your oil is hot, dip the ice cream scoop in the water, take a heaping batch of batter, and drop it into the oil. As it begins to fry, turn the scoop over, and use the convex side to gently pat-and-spread the scoop of batter down into a more pancake like shape. Repeat until your pan is full but not crowded. (About four latkes fit comfortably in a 12" pan.) Return the scoop to the water glass after each latke and in between batches.

7. OPTIONAL STEP: If you're like me, you have an electric stove whose burner is just a little smaller than your pan. Sadly, that means there's way more heat in the center of your oil than at the edges. To overcome that, about 30 seconds into cooking, rotate each of your latkes 180°, like so:

8. While frying, watch the heat. You may want to crank the heat up a bit when each batch first goes in, to offset the cooling, then dial it back down as the oil comes up to temperature.

9. Flip each latke when the bottom side is well-browned but not blackened. It will continue cooking even after you flip it. As with regular pancakes, the second side won't need as long. To check for doneness, gently touch the surface of a frying latke. It should give a little but feel firm, not mushy – about the same as the surface of a medium steak. (Less complicated method: Take one out and eat it.)

10. Place on a baking sheet in a hot oven until all your latkes are finished frying.

11. Serve with applesauce and/or sour cream.
