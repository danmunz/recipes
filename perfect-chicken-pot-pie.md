# Perfect Chicken Pot Pie

## Notes

This is a pretty complicated recipe, but I promise you, it's worth it. Lightly adapted from [Smitten Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/11/chicken-pot-pie/), which in turn was adapted from [Ina Garten](http://www.barefootcontessa.com/recipes.aspx?RecipeID=82&S=0) - but this recipe is really my own.

## Ingredients

### The Crust

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 3/4 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1 1/3 sticks cold unsalted butter, diced
* 1/2 cup ice water

_(For later, when baking)_

* 1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water
* flaked sea salt and cracked black pepper
* 1/2 tsp loose thyme leaves

### The Chicken

* 2 whole chicken breasts, bone-in, skin-on
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* salt & pepper
* any other seasonings you like on chicken: garlic powder, herbs de provence, etc.

### The Filling

* 1/2 large yellow onion or 2 large shallots, diced
* 2 large ribs celery, diced
* 4 small carrots, peeled and diced
* 10 pearl onions, blanched and peeled (frozen pearl onions also work fine, but you put them in later in the recipe)
* 10 crimini mushrooms, caps quartered
* 1 tsp fresh thyme
* 2 cloves minced fresh garlic
* 1/2 tsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp tomato paste
* 1 tbsp white wine

* a handful of parsley (about 1/2 cup), roughly chopped
* 1/2 cup green peas, frozen (or blanched if fresh)

### The Magic

* 6 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup flour
* 3/4 cups chicken stock
* 1 tsp bullion, or an equivalent amount of an equivalent product like [Better Than Bullion](http://www.superiortouch.com/retail/products/better-than-bouillon) 
* 1/8 cup heavy cream
* healthy glug or two of a very dry sherry (1-2 tbsp)
* 1 tsp lemon juice

## Instructions

First, make the pastry. Mix the flour, salt, cayenne pepper, and baking powder in a large bowl. Add the butter, and mix it quickly with your fingers or one of these awesome [handheld dough blenders](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Grips-Dough-Blender-Blades/dp/B000QJE48O), until each piece is coated with flour and the whole mix has the texture of wet sand. Add the ice water, and knead until the dough comes together. Dump the dough out onto a floured board and knead it quickly into a ball. (You can also do all the previous steps in a food processor, but doing it by hand really couldn't be easier.) Wrap the dough in plastic and allow it to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to a day or two.

Next, it's chicken time. Heat the oven to 350. Dry the chicken breasts well with paper towels, and rub them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and herbs. Put them on a rack over a shallow pan (<a href="http://eddyskitchen.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/chicken-on-rack-for-dripping.jpg">like this</a>), and bake them for an hour, until the skin looks crispy and bubbly. (Bonus: Splash some white wine into the shallow pan before it goes into the oven. It'll get the chicken steaming and make everything smell fragrant and generally great.) Once the chicken is cooked, set it aside and let it cool. Pull the skin off of the breasts, and pull the meat into half-inch to one-inch pieces. (And, if you're like me, eat the chicken skin.)

Okay, Act I of chicken pot pie is complete. This is probably a good time to do some kitchen cleanup.

Act II begins with vegetables. But there's a little bit of an intermission before Act II, and its theme is _mise en place_. Heat the chicken stock in a small saucepan until it's just scalding, and dissolve the bullion in it. Keep it sitting on low heat. This step takes a little bit of time, and when you need the broth, you'll want it to be warm and ready.

Heat a large dutch oven over medium heat. Pour in some olive oil, and add the onion, celery, carrots, and pearl onions if using fresh ones. Season with black pepper (but not salt!), and cook, covered, for about four minutes. Add half the fresh thyme and the garlic, and cook, covered, for another 1-2mins. Set aside in a large bowl.

Add another big glug or two of olive oil to the dutch oven, and add the mushrooms. Add salt and pepper, and cook, covered, for about four minutes. Add the tomato paste and the other half of the thyme, and stir to incorporate. Cook for a minute. Add the white wine and soy sauce, and keep cooking until it's fully reduced and glazed onto the mushrooms. Add the mushrooms with the other sautéed vegetables.

So far, you have chicken, vegetables, and dough. Now, it's time to make the part that brings it all together - _the magic_. Before we proceed, a word on what exactly this stuff..._is_. I call it "the magic" in part because it really is the stuff that makes this taste like a homemade hug in your mouth instead of frozen re-heated fast-food chicken pot gloop, but also because...I really don't know what else to call it. It's not sauce; a sauce is usually delicious on its own, a culinary co-star or at least a memorable supporting actor. The substance you're about to make wouldn't be eaten by itself unless there was a bar bet riding on it. It's also not "binder"; binder is usually a substance like bread crumbs whose Sole Purpose In Life is to turn your mixture into a single coherent solid. It's the duct tape of the culinary world. This stuff, on the other hand, is full of depth and flavor and _soul_. It's what makes the kitchen smell like what you imagine your grandma's kitchen always smelling like. This is not binder. I suppose we _could_ just call this what it is: An extremely flavorful butter-based roux. But we'll shorthand it as "the magic." 

So, let's make some magic. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and melt the butter over low heat in the same dutch oven you used for the veggies, and _don't clean it out_, lest the undead ghost of [Louis-Camille Maillard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction) visit your kitchen. Once the butter is bubbling quietly, add the flour, whisking it vigorously to get out the lumps. Cook for about two minutes, stirring, until the mixture starts to brown. Add the warm stock, and keep whisking for a minute. (The stock should thin the mixture out a bit. If it seems like the stock just disappears immediately, move the pot off the heat and reduce the heat, add a little water to the mixture, and put it back on the lower heat. It should have the consistency of a very thick gravy, but _not_ a paste.) Add the cream, and a healthy pinch of salt and pepper. Keep stirring. Finally, add the lemon juice and sherry, and move the pot off the heat. At this point, you should be able to run a whisk cleanly through the mixture, without taking any of it with you.  Also at this point, your kitchen should smell like heaven.

Once the mixture settles down, it's time for everyone to get in the pool: The chicken, the veggies, the parsley, and the peas (and the pearl onions, if using frozen ones). Mix it _well_ to combine, and dump the whole thing into a 9" oven-safe pie dish.

Take your dough out of the fridge, and roll it into a circle on a floured board. Try to work quickly; your fridge has been hard at work keeping those big butter clumps solid, and you want to honor that effort with speed. Once you have a dough disk about 1" wider than the diameter of your pie dish, pop it on top of the dish. Crimp the edges, and just generally fuss over it until it looks presentable.

Brush the dough all over with egg wash, and make 3 slits in the top. Sprinkle all over with sea salt, cracked pepper, and scattered thyme leaves. (You don't _have_ to do this. But after all the work you've already done, you're going to cut corners now?) Bake on 375 for about an hour, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbling hot.

Smile.
