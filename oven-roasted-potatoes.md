# Oven-Roasted Potatoes

## Notes

This recipe is loosely based on [Ina Garten's basic one](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/garlic-roasted-potatoes-recipe.html), but the combination of herbs and spices here is pretty special. The garlic, thyme and rosemary put this pretty close to a "steakhouse potatoes" recipe, but the oregano and paprika (hot, _not_ sweet) take it a bit south; you wind up with something like Brazilian steakhouse potatoes. But at the end of the day, these are just delicious all-purpose oven-roasted potatoes, and they'll quickly become your go-to for serving aside steak, chicken, or anything else that needs something hearty but not heavy. Also, they make your house smell friggin' amazing.

A few keys to success here:

* Soaking the potatoes, even for a little while, really does seem to pull out some starch and get the potatoes crispy, not steamy.

* It's important to let the herbs/spices steep in the oil for a while. I'm convinced that not doing this is the difference between okay potatoes and great ones. Ultimately, all the little pieces of garlic and herb won't all stick to the potatoes, but the oil will; hence, flavoring the oil is key.

* Speaking of oil, don't use too much. You're roasting the potatoes, not shallow-frying them; too much oil will, paradoxically, cause your potatoes to start steaming. You want crispy, not steamy.

## Ingredients

* 2-3 cups potatoes, cut into 1" cubes and soaked in water to remove starch
* 2-3 cloves garlic, minced fine
* 1 tbsp fresh oregano, chopped
* 1/2 tbsp fresh thyme, chopped
* 1 tsp fresh rosemary, chopped fine
* 1/2 tsp smoked spanish paprika
* 1/8 cup olive oil
* sea salt
* fresh black pepper

## Instructions

Heat an oven to 400 degrees.

Combine the garlic, oregano, thyme, rosemary, paprika, and oil. Mix well and let the mixture sit for at least half an hour. This helps ensure that the herbs and spices infuse the oil.

Finish soaking the potatoes and dry them well. Toss the potatoes with the mixture, ensuring they mix well, and let them sit together for at least ten minutes. I do this in a bowl, but  you could probably use a ziploc bag.

Add a generous pinch of salt and black pepper, toss the mixture once more, and spread it out onto a small sheet tray. You want one small enough that the potatoes all kind of sit in the spice mixture, but large enough that they don't touch. (Kind of [like this](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR7JV_ZFBnh9siV_E0n0NJRiAyLMKhmLELt_ZBYETt1vd09-oTO), _not_ [like this](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT-17kZWb0syOFrwI9F6I2_CGL2od6IUSv83SEGVZaSM1tqwYVN)) 
Make sure you get all the oil out of the bowl and onto the tray along with the potatoes and herbs - remember, that's where the flavor is!

Bake the whole thing for 30-45 minutes, tossing them lightly with a spatula every 15 minutes. You'll know they're done when they look brown and crispy on the outside and are creamy but not mushy in the middle, [like this](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/sites/bbcgoodfood.com/files/recipe_images/recipe-image-legacy-id--20241_11.jpg).

Take them out and let them cool for a few minutes. Eat them. [Like this.](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131123155641/doodledoug-and-ronaldmcmotherfingdonald/images/e/e7/Squidward-eating-krabby-patties.gif)
