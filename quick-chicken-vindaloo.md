# Quick Chicken Vindaloo

![image](/img/chicken_vindaloo.png)

## Notes
This is a great way to use up leftovers. The first time I made this, I used leftover smoked BBQ chicken thigh as the protein and it was awesome. This just makes your kitchen smell incredible. The heat comes from both the chilis in the aromatics and the spices in the stew base; adjust both up or down to your liking. If you don't have some of the aromatics like mustard seed or cumin seed in whole form, just add their powdered versions and slightly reduce how long you cook the aromatics before adding your meat and veggies.

This makes one serving.

## Ingredients

### Aromatics:
- 1 tbsp ghee
- 3 cloves garlic, sliced thin
- 1/2” ginger, sliced thin
- 1/2 tsp chili flake or dried chilis
- 1 tsp mustard seed
- 1/2 tsp cumin seed
- 1 pod worth of green cardamom seeds

### Veggies & Protein
- 4oz chicken thigh cut into 1/2” strips
- 4oz potato diced into 1/2” cubes
- Half a medium onion diced into 1/2” pieces (and/or 1/2 cup of just about any other veggies you like; carrots, zucchini, cauliflower would all be great)

### Stew Base
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1/4 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp paprika (smoked or sweet, depending on your preference)
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp coriander
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp curry powder
- 1/4 cup white vinegar
- 1/2 cup chicken stock

## Instructions
1. Place the ghee and aromatics in a cold nonstick pan on the stove. Put the pan on medium heat.
2. Once the ghee has melted and the aromatics are gently sizzling, cook for 2-3 minutes until fragrant.
3. Add, chicken, potatoes, onion, and any other vegetables you're using. Salt lightly. Cook for 10 minutes until chicken browns and potato starts to soften.
4. Add tomato paste, sugar and additional spices. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring to let the paste get incorporated and spices get toasted.
5. Add the vinegar and chicken stock. Simmer on medium-high heat until liquid is mostly dissolved and the vindaloo has taken on a thicker, stew-like consistency. Stir occasionally.
6. Season to taste. Serve over warm jasmine rice.
