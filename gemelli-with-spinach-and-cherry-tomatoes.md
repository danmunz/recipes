# Gemelli with Spinach and Cherry Tomatoes

## Notes
- I need to come back and improve the writing here, but I made this one night and it was so stupid good I want to write it down before I forget it 

## Ingredients

- 13 oz gemelli pasta, or some other shape with lots of zigzags and surfaces
- ~20 cherry tomatoes, sliced in half
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 medium shallots, diced
- 5oz fresh spinach (about one entire small bag)
- 1/4 cup vermouth
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 2 tbsp heavy cream
- 3 tbsp good tomato paste
- 1/4 cup Extra virgin olive oil
- Parmesan cheese, to finish 

## Instructions
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil on the stove
2. In a saucepan, heat 1/4 cup olive oil on medium heat. When hot, add the garlic and onions. Saut√©e until soft/translucent but not brown, 3-4 min. (Sautee until it smells really good basically)
3. Add tomatoes and a large pinch of salt. Stir and turn up the heat to medium high. Let cook for a while. Add the pasta to the water at this point. 
4. Once the tomatoes are breaking down, add the tomato paste and sugar. Stir and keep cooking. 
5. Add the vermouth & stir the pan to deglaze. Reduce the heat to medium. 
6. Add the chicken broth and spinach and stir. Let simmer gently. 
7. When the pasta is almost done but not quite, scoop it into the sauce pan with a spider or slotted spoon. Let it finish cooking in the sauce. If the sauce reduces too much, scoop some of the pasta water into it.
8. Once the pasta is cooked and the sauce is a good consistency, take the mixture off the heat. Add cream and stir. Salt to taste. 
9. Serve in bowls. Top with Parmesan cheese.
