## Notes

This is the classic French toast. To paraphrase [the rifleman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifleman's_Creed), there are many recipes like this one, but this one is mine, and it's fed my family very happily for many a Saturday. The ingredients are dead simple and unfussy; I love raisin challah, but honestly, almost any rich bread you can muster up here will do. Have cream but not milk? Fine! Want to use a little more or less vanilla, or toss in some nutmeg? Have at it!

The real trick here, the real secret, isn't in the ingredients, but rather, the timing and the technique. Really, this is a two-part recipe: The first part is all timing, and the second part is all technique. I can promise this: Get both right, and you'll see some very rewarding Saturday morning smiles.

## Ingredients
* Four large slices of raisin challah, cut about 3/4" thick 
* 3 large eggs, beaten or 3/4 cup egg substitute
* 1/2 cup whole milk
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* generous pinch kosher or sea salt
* 2 tbsp unsalted butter
* maple syrup

## Instructions
In a large, shallow baking dish (say, big enough to fit four large slices of raisin challah), whisk together the eggs, milk, cinnamon, vanilla, brown sugar, and salt, making sure to combine well.

###Part one: The timing

Heat a nonstick griddle pan over medium heat. Upon turning on the heat, settle the challah slices in the egg mixture.

Set a timer for three minutes. [Not two, not four, but three.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOrgLj9lOwk) Swoosh the dish around a little bit, making sure the mixture really coats the sides of the bread.

When the timer goes off, _gently_ flip the challah slices, and set a timer for two minutes.

When _that_ timer goes off, put your butter onto the griddle. It should sizzle, but not smoke.

Set a timer for one minute (or, hell, just count to sixty). Use this last 60 seconds to swish the challah around in the egg mixture, absorbing as much as possible.

When the timer goes off _or_ when the butter is fully melted and gently bubbling - whichever comes last - _gently_ lift your  challah out of the dish and put it on the griddle.

###Part two: The technique 

Now that your bread is on the griddle...don't set a timer.

_Seriously? The actual cooking is the part of this that doesn't use a timer?_

That's right. The rate at which challah soaks up an egg-milk-flavor mixture is precise. It's a physical constant. You can set a watch by it. The rate at which that bread combines with heat and butter to transform into French toast, on the other hand, is art. It's poetry. It's ineffable, dependent on a thousand different variables. So, this is where we abandon the world of timers, and enter the world of judgment.

The basic instruction is this: Cook one side until it looks like something you want to eat. Flip it, and cook the other side until it, too, looks like something you want to eat. This is probably _roughly_ 3-4 minutes a side, but your senses are your only reliable guides. They're looking for, basically, two things:

* Dark golden brown...marbling, for lack of a better term. You want things to get really golden brown. Why? Think about what's happening: Bread is toasting. Brown sugar is caramelizing. Eggs are cooking. Milk solids in the milk and butter are cooking. _Simultaneously!_ With all that happening, you want to see a deep golden brown on there. _But no black._ Black is what milk solids look like when they burn, and burnt milk is not what you want your French toast to taste like. So, [like Kramer on a test drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuEdU_lrtZk), you simply have to push the toast as far as you can without having her burn up on you.

* Firmness. French toast is actually a bit like a steak, in that you can test doneness by gently poking it and seeing how much give there is. Also like steak, the right answer is: Firm, but forgiving. No one wants to bite into French toast only to realize that the inside of their French toast has been replaced with Hot Wet Egg Bread. On the other hand, French toast, unlike actual toast, should not make a crispy crackling sound when cut or bitten into.

So those are the things to watch for. Don't be shy about checking your toast, moving it around the griddle, fiddling with the heat if you need to, or adding more butter. You're painting here, man. You're Picasso, and the griddle is your canvas. Plus, the cost of doing this wrong is extremely low. All in, you could probably mix another batch from scratch, start to finish, in under 10 minutes if you really had to.

Once your bread has become French toast, and your sense tell you things are where they should be, life gets easy. Plate the toast, and top it with as much room-temperature maple syrup as you like.

Eat up.

Smile.
