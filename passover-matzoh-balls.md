## Notes
- Adapted from https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-matzo-ball-soup, with some significant improvements.
- This makes about 16 medium-sized matzoh balls.

## Ingredients

6 large eggs, beaten
1/2 cup melted schmaltz (chicken fat) or vegetable oil, or a mix of both
1/4 cup chicken broth
2 tbsp seltzer
3 tbsp chopped dill
3 tbsp chopped chives
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp baking powder
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
3/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 3/4 cups matzo meal

## Instructions
1. In a large bowl, combine all ingredients except the matzoh meal. Whisk thoroughly to combine.
2. Add the matzoh meal. Stir thoroughly to combine.
3. Transfer the mixture to a ziploc bag and refrigerate for at least an hour.
4. Lay an oiled parchment paper on a baking sheet. Scoop the mixture out of the ziploc with a medium-sized ice cream scoop and form it gently into balls of approximately 2" diameter. Lay them on the baking sheet to chill in the fridge.
5. Bring a pot of chicken broth to a low simmer, not quite a boil. Gently drop the matzoh balls into the pot. Simmer for 40 minutes, or until the matzoh balls are fully tender in the middle.
