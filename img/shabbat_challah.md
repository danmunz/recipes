## Notes
Adapted from [The Cuban Reuben](http://thecubanreuben.com/shabbat-challah/).

## Ingredients
- 2 1/4 tsp dry active yeast
- 1 1/2 tsp plus 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 tsp plus 1 tbsp honey
- 3/4 cup warm water
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 2 eggs, plus 2 egg yolks, plus 1 egg for egg wash
- 2 tsp kosher salt (or 1 1/2 tsp table salt)
- 4 cups flour or less

## Instructions
1. Warm 3/4 cups of water in a microwave. Lukewarm (about 110 degrees is ideal).
2. In a large bowl, add yeast, 1 1/2 tsp sugar, 1 tsp honey, 3/4 cup warm water, and mix until dissolved. Let sit for 10 minutes or until bubbles form visibly.
3. Mix in vegetable oil, 2 eggs, 2 egg yolks, remaining sugar, remaining honey, and salt. Stir gently to combine.
4. Add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring with each addition to fold in the flour. When the dough holds together, dump onto a floured surface and knead until smooth.
5. Transfer dough to a greased bowl, cover with a towel, and let rise in a warm place for 3-4 hours, punching it down once halfway through. If the top of the dough looks or feels dry, gently oil it to prevent cracking during the rise.
6. Dump risen dough onto a well-floured surface. Cut into 6 pieces, and roll into approximately 12-inch strands. Pinch the top of the strands together. [Braid them into a challah shape.](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FqDvfCopkRU/WKkISo5rL7I/AAAAAAAAMDU/I3y8rPwUHbEwwnge3MREsftOZ9k_QwVSQCLcB/s1600/6%2Bstrand%2Bchallah%2Bdiagramb-01.png) Pinch the ends, and tuck them under the loaf. Place the braided loaf on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
7. Use your last egg to brush an egg wash over the top of the loaf. Save this egg wash in the fridge.
8. Let the washed challah sit for one hour.
9. Brush a second coat of egg wash. At this point, you can sprinkle poppy seeds, sesame seeds, or any other seeded topping you want.
10. Bake at 350 for 30-40 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted into the middle of the challah reads 185.
