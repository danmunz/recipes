# Sichuan Chili Oil

## Notes
I've loved Sichuan food for a while now, but the decision to try making my own chili oil was inspired by [a recent Weibo overview of Lao Gan Ma](https://www.whatsonweibo.com/lao-gan-ma-story-chinas-spicy-godmother-tao-huabi/). Lao Gan Ma (literally "old godmother") is a Chinese food product with a matriarchal founder/mascot who has become the face of chili oil in China, and who has built a vast business empire atop her vaguely [Mom-from-Futurama](http://theinfosphere.org/Mom)-like relationship with her thousands of devotees.

After trying to get my hands on her sauce, to no avail, it occurred to me I didn't want her sauce. I wanted something that would feel to me the way her sauce feels to its Chinese adherents: Like something your actual grandma used to make. My actual grandma never made Sichuan chili oil (though the thought of it spread over her brisket is simultaneously smile- and saliva-inducing), but there was no reason I couldn't have a version that does what all great grandma cooking does: Requires a little too much effort, fills the house with incredible smells, and tastes just-made and exactly the way you've always liked it.

We're going for something halfway between an oil and a _condiment_, in the classical sense: Imagine a fruit-less chutney, or a meat-less bolognese. We want a seasoned oil that's also somehow chunky and chewy. We want spice, but we want it well-balanced with other flavors. We want something that you could put on absolutely everything. After browsing about a hundred different recipes/YouTube videos, this recipe is what I've landed on. 

This is one of those recipes that seems mysterious, despite (or maybe because of) having highly fungible moving parts. All you _strictly_ need to come out having made Sichuan chili oil is chilis and oil, with some Sichuan peppercorn probably on just this side of the "required" line. The other inclusions aren't _optional_, per se, but they're definitely in that second "some grandmas always used it, some grandmas never used it" tier of ingredients. This recipe is on the maximalist end of those inclusions, because I like fussiness and complexity of flavor but also because it's easier to customize it by taking out stuff you don't like. (Ingredients that are _truly_ optional here are denoted as such below.)

Anyhow, the key here turns out not to be the ingredients, but the technique - or, more appropriately, the solution. If you think about it, this recipe is trying to solve a problem: We want to come out with a relatively heavy condiment - an oil - that can stand up to Sichuan staples like doughy noodles, fatty meats, fried fish, and the like. So it needs to be _loud_. The volume needs to be turned up. But for the same reason, we want some pretty intricate flavors. It has to have enough complexity to anchor a dish in ways that ordinary condiments can't. Noodles mixed with straight Sriracha would be inedible; rice mixed with ketchup is what twelve-year-olds make for dinner when mom is stuck at work; but rice or noodles mixed in good Sichuan chili oil are quite legitimately a delicacy.

The question, basically, is: How do you get a food item that behaves in practical terms like a condiment but participates in the flavors of a dish the way its main ingredients would? The answer is to separate this dish into two parts: An aggressive base of chilis, garlic, peppercorns, and salt, and a fragrant cooking oil infused with many other subtle flavors.

You start by infusing vegetable oil with dry spices and other items that can take a real beating, content to give their flavors up then be discarded. You let that intensely flavored oil cool _a little_, then pour it slowly over the chili base. If done right, the hot oil bubbles up, flash-cooking the chilis, garlic and peppercorns without burning them. This rehydrates the chilis and peppercorns, takes the edge off of the fresh garlic, and extracts all of their flavors efficiently into the overall mixture. Effectively, what you're making is a small pot of oil-braised chilis. The resulting flavor is both balanced and intense, with no burnt notes. It works in much the same way, and is venerated for much the same reasons, as the pourover is among cafinistas.

Recipes say the stuff keeps basically forever in the fridge. If you want go the whole nine yards, you could [make fresh biang biang noodles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aazfj36HCV4#t=02m00s). But the whole point here is that this stuff would taste good on a wet shoe, so just toss it with your next pasta/rice/meat/eggs concoction and you'll be smiling like one of Lao Gan Ma's many (many) godchildren.

## Ingredients
### The chili base
- 3/4 cups red chili flakes
_these can be [purchased as flakes](https://themalamarket.com/collections/all/products/sichuan-chili-flakes-xiang-la-jiao-mian?aff=2) or made from [whole dried chilis](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Squirrels-Szechuan-Whole-Chilies/dp/B01NASAQ63/) and crushed in a ziploc bag or blender_
- 4-5 cloves garlic, minced finely
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns, lightly crushed
- 1 tbsp crushed peanuts (optional)

### The hot oil
_These are arranged in order of importance to the recipe, as I perceive them. Everything below the star anise is genuinely optional._

- 1.5 cups vegetable oil
- 4 star anise pods
- 1 stick cinnamon
- 3 bay leaves
- 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorns, whole
- 1 small knob ginger, peeled
- 1-2 black cardamom pods
- 1 green cardamom pod
- 2 scallions, cut into 2" lengths

### Additions (all optional)
- 1 tsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp Chinkiang vinegar
- 1 tbsp roasted sesame seeds

## Instructions
In a large heatproof(!) bowl, combine chili flakes, salt, garlic, and Sichuan peppercorns. Mix lightly to combine and set aside.

In a small saucepan, combine the oil with all other "hot oil" ingredients. Turn the heat on medium-low, and cook until the ingredients start to turn dark and "frizzle" a little in the oil.

Remove the solid ingredients from the oil with a slotted spoon, and take it off the heat. Let it cool down just briefly - _maybe_ 30 seconds - and pour a tablespoon of the oil over the chili mixture. It should bubble up and make a light frying sound; if it doesn't, heat the oil back up on the stove for a few seconds. Working quickly, add the hot oil, 1-2 tablespoons at a time, stirring between additions, until the chilis are fully covered. Give it a final stir and gradually pour in the rest of the oil.

Let the mixture cool a bit, and add whichever additions please you. Cool completely and stir in a lidded vessel - ideally a mason jar - for as long as you want. Shake or stir well before using, and add to dishes a spoonful at a time.
